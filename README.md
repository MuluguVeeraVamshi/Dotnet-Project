PROJECT TITLE: "Grocery Shopping Application System"

ABSTRACT: 

One of the key benefits of a grocery e-commerce website is convenience.
Customers can shop from anywhere with an internet connection, and have their
groceries delivered directly to their doorstep. This is particularly useful for
customers who may have difficulty leaving their homes, or who are unable to
visit a physical grocery store. Additionally, many grocery e-commerce websites
offer features such as subscription services and personalized recommendations,
which can help customers save time and money on their grocery shopping.
Overall, a well-designed and efficient grocery e-commerce website can be a
valuable asset for any grocery store or food retailer looking to expand their
customer base and offer more convenience to their customers.


REQUIREMENTS: Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, Microsoft
Visual Studio (with .net packages installed).
